# API Wars

## About

API Wars is a web application which lets you browse through info about the planets of the Star Wars universe, using data from the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>.

This is one of the first web apps that I've built, so it doesn't use any fancy tools, libraries or frameworks (except for Flask). Because of that, it helped gain a solid understanding of the basics of HTTP communication, responsive design, data persistence and DOM manipulation. It also made me better appreciate the help of more complex technologies that I worked with later in my journey, like React, Bootstrap, Spring Boot and Hibernate.

API Wars is deployed on on Heroku, so you can <a href="">try it out</a>.
